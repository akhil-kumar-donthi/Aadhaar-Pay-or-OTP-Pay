# Aadhaar-Pay-or-OTP-Pay
Aadhaar Pay for basic Mobile Phones as well as Smart Phones.

To Readers or Evaluators,

My name is Akhil and I am a Software Developer. 
By using Java, BI and UI technologies I can develop both Web and Desktop based Applications and Tools. 
I am a Web Application Developer. I don't know developing Mobile Applications. So This project don't have any code.


I already submitted this Application in Digital India AatmaNirbhar Bharat Innovate Challenge. And respective old Submission ID is : 5962313.

I didn't notice that Submitted Date is Updated. I didn't get a time to improvise my thesis. So in a hurry I submitted this Innovation. I hope you understand my Words.

And please consider "Aadhaar Pay or OTP Pay Version 2.0" as Final Document. I update few features in Version 2.0. 

Majorly there are 3 difference between Version 1.0 and Version 2.0
1) Instead of Controlling PIN use Aadhaar PIN in Version 2.0. And Aadhaar PIN is almost similar to ATM pin.

2) In version 2.0 Personal Transfer is possible. But Receiver should use Smartphones.

3) Shopkeepers ID and Transaction ID is combined In Version 2.0. To decrease SMS length.


For more details please refer attached Documentation. 







I hope these Innovations are leads towards Digital India. This project is related to Government of India and World too. If my thesis is feasible in both Technically and Practically. Then I would like to be part of the Development team.

If you have any queries please contact me.

Thanks

Akhil
