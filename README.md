# Aadhaar-Pay-or-OTP-Pay
Aadhaar Pay for basic Mobile Phones as well as Smart Phones.

To Readers or Evaluators,

My name is Akhil and I am a Software Developer. 
By using Java, BI and UI technologies I can develop both Web and Desktop based Applications and Tools. 
I am a Web Application Developer. I don't know developing Mobile Applications. So This project don't have any code.

Present System

At present, Customer or Digital Users are scan Shopkeepers QR code to transfer money from Digital Users Mobile Wallets to Shopkeepers Mobile Wallets.

Proposed System

Shopkeepers scan Customer Aadhaar Card QR code (or Respective Aadhaar Pay ID) And from Server Customer get OTP to their Registered Mobile Number. Give it to Shopkeeper. Finally shopkeeper enter that OTP and transfer money from ACH Account to Shopkeeper Account.

I hope these Innovations are leads towards Digital India. This project is related to Government of India and World too. If my thesis is feasible in both Technically and Practically. Then I would like to be part of the Development team.

If you have any queries please contact me.

Thanks

Akhil
